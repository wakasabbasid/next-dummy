00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.570
<v 1>Hello, Mr. Snail. All you cute little corn person,</v>

2
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.490
Latin name, bonus points.

3
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.610
<v 2>Can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger.</v>

4
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.130
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,

5
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.410
I swear I'm going to kill her. Relax sugar buns while she does all the work,

6
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.970
we'll have all the fun.

7
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.600
<v 1>Yeah. And get wasted out of our minds. We're way ahead of you, man.</v>

8
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.890
Come on team. We must dilly dally when there's so much nature to see.

9
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.330
I was thinking we should call our class project Fun Guys and a forest.

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.010
Get it because we're a group of fun guys. And also fun guys. Shush.

11
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.970
And she's in distress. They're very little. Monte Flower,

12
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.570
look at your girl.

13
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 2>Wow. Out of the way. Do one. We are camping here.</v>

14
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.050
Finally turn to get that barbecue burning. Oh dear.

15
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.080
<v 1>Easy guys. We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it. Piss break.</v>

16
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.930
<v 2>Oy fungus free. Make yourself useful and fix the tent. A bit of.</v>

17
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.370
<v 1>Friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.</v>

18
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.490
<v 2>She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods. Yeah,</v>

19
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.690
she's a real weenie. That one isn't it? Boy, Phil, are no sausages coming?

20
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.290
Almost ready. Chris. Need a bit more salt.

21
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
Incredible. A new species. What the bloody hell are those things?

22
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.810
It's like a note shack. The mushroom.

23
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.423
<v 0>The.</v>

24
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.490
<v 2>They're absolutely adorable. Yeah, absolutely. Bloody adorable.</v>

25
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.570
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things. We'd be famous.

26
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.570
Get on.

27
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 1>MTV. I wonder what they taste like. Oh,</v>

28
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.930
we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat, right? Sure, sure.

29
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.250
<v 2>Greetings, welcome friends, I'll be right down.</v>

30
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.130
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea? What are you guys?

31
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.610
We are sprays. We spray balance to the forest. We take care of the animals,

32
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.573
birds.

33
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.650
<v 1>Guys, guys, a small.</v>

34
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.570
<v 2>Grass. Hey little mushroom geezer. You call with us camping here for the night.</v>

35
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.930
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

36
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.450
<v 1>Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint.</v>

37
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.930
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

38
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.473
<v 0>Guys.</v>

39
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.370
<v 1>Guys, guys, this isn't funny</v>

40
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.033
guys.

41
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.400
<v 2>We were just going to catch one. But they're psycho.</v>

42
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.330
You've got to get me out of these. Hurry. They going to kill us.

43
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.810
You pick the wrong camping spot. Bitches. Spray.

44
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.433
<v 0>What?</v>

45
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.130
Yes, yes.

46
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.690
<v 1>I don't want to hurt you. Just keep your distance.</v>

47
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.610
Call right then eat. I'll do little green.

48
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.810
<v 2>Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin.</v>

49
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.250
And you set them free. Now you join them.

50
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.450
I'll give you that one brother bird. Alright,

51
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.610
sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

52
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.800
Keep in touch with every round

53
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.970
before happy home he all together. Now

54
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.890
the sun, Frankie, Frankie.

55
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.130
<v 3>The Frankie Yum. Danger. Danger.</v>

56
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.130
I'm a forest ranger about and clear the way I'm about the blasted stick

57
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.410
like plastic. What's your mama going to say to drop it?

58
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.770
Stanky drop it. I'm going to just catch you in steam. Now pitch and nu it.

59
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.250
I'm polluted lake to the river to the stream. For spot

60
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.290
with little dear and comic cavalry. Try to cut me down two sides nowadays.

61
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.010
My announcer driver bouncer bacon, me cakes and pies.

62
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.490
This camp is a cut here. Fight me and my crew. Don't play.

63
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.370
Boots on the log on the frog. Cut words in the truth.
